        <marquee>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only
            domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
            distinguish it from the wild members of the family.</marquee>

        <marquee> A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
            contact.</marquee>
        <marquee direction="right">Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
            rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</marquee>
        <small><strong>cThe cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. </strong></small>

            Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like<br/>
            meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A<br/>
            predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social<br/>
            species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice<br/>
            and other small mammals.[7] Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[8]<br/>

            Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two<br/>
            to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known<br/>
            as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation<br/>
            and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the<br/>
            extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]<br/>

            It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around<br/>
            3100 BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication<br/>
            occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13]<br/>

            As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of <br/>
            2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats <br/>
            owned[16][17][18] and around 42 million households own at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of <br/>
            adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020 <br/>

            The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a <br/>
            human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500â€“7200 BC. Since there is no <br/>
            evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought <br/>
            the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[48] Scientists therefore <br/>
            assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, <br/>
            in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship <br/>
            between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did <br/>
            tame and domesticated cats.[13][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic <br/>
            cat at a later time.[49] <br/>

            The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, <br/>
            Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe.[50] During the <br/>
            Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium.[51] By <br/>
            the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.[52] By the <br/>
            end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a <br/>
            Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.[49] <br/>

            During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still <br/>
            capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have <br/>
            pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious <br/>
            body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display <br/>
            affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated.[53] House cats often mate with feral <br/>
            cats.[54] Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such <br/>
            as the Kellas cat in Scotland.[55][56] <br/>

            Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.[57] An analysis of the domestic cat genome <br/>
            revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as <br/>
            specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds.[58] Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic <br/>
            cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which <br/>
            show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.[59] <br/>
